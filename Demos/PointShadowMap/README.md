# Point Shadow Map
Point shadow maps are generated by rendering all the objects in the scene, as is to an off screen render target where the objects will be rotated 360 degrees in the cube map formation.
Because of this, we need 6 instances (+X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z) of the same mesh submitted to the pipeline. 
```c++
for(UI8 face = 0; face < 6; face++)
{
	Matrix4x4 viewMatrix = GetFaceMatrix(face);
	pDynamicStates->SetConstantData(Flint::ShaderType::VERTEX, &viewMatrix, sizeof(Matrix4x4));

	pPipeline->AddDrawData(shadowResoutceMap, pDynamicStates, instance.mVertexOffset, instance.mVertexCount, instance.mIndexOffset, instance.mIndexCount);
}
```

As an optimization, the resources are pre-bound to command buffers. This means that frequently changing content in the shadow map will result in worst performance.
Make sure that the number of off screen render pass changes (adding and removing pipelines, along with pipeline content) are minimal.
